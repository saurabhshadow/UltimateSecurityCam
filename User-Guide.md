* <p>"Do I always need dedicated staff to ensure the seurity of the premises secured by the camera ?" . "Can't a camera do the task of montoring itself ? "  Our camera will solve these real - life problems</p>

* An easy-to-build, un-hackable security software which detects any intruder and alerts the owner.

* This software we'll make it un-hack-able by using microphone and eliminating every possible hack to fool our software.

* The technology used is **Python 3.6** with **Opencv** which makes it more **safe**!

## How it Works?🔧

<p>We take a snapshot of the room, lets call this base.jpg. Now, the code continuously scan the current frame and subtract it from base.jpg. If the difference is more than a threshold , we'll consider a breach happening.</p>

- Steps it takes:
	- The code first initializes a three seconds waiting camera window.
	- The main code runs to detect movements and record the complete video footage.
	- All the configurations of the video clip are recorded (like Date and Time, camera fps, maximum object movement recorded at a time, duration, etc.)
	- The video clip and configuration data is saved for future reference and the code terminates.
